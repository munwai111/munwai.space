# Email Functionality Debug Todo

## Phase 1: Investigate current email implementation and identify issues
- [x] Check current contact form implementation in App.jsx (FOUND: Form exists with validation)
- [x] Identify email sending mechanism (FOUND: Trying to POST to https://3005-i1cglnf8uh2n9trw2zj6f-22ecaed3.manusvm.computer/api/contact)
- [x] Check for any backend email service integration (ISSUE: No backend server running at that URL)
- [x] Verify form submission handling (FOUND: handleFormSubmit function exists)
- [x] Check browser console for any JavaScript errors (LIKELY: Network errors due to missing backend)
- [x] Document current implementation gaps (ISSUE: Form tries to POST to non-existent backend API)

## Phase 2: Implement working email functionality
- [x] Choose appropriate email service (CHOSEN: Formspree - reliable, no API keys needed)
- [x] Set up email service configuration (DONE: Created emailService.js utility)
- [x] Implement email sending logic (DONE: Updated handleFormSubmit function)
- [x] Configure email template with user's Gmail (DONE: Formspree forwards to munwai3939728@gmail.com)
- [x] Add proper error handling and success feedback (DONE: Added fallback mailto option)
