# Fix Intro Animation Issues

## Issues to Fix:
1. **Writing Effect**: Change from character-by-character typing to word-by-word writing (words appear all at once)
2. **Transition Problem**: Fix fade-out transition to properly reveal the portfolio homepage

## Phase 1: Fix animation logic for word-by-word writing and transition
- [x] Modify IntroAnimation.jsx to show words appearing all at once instead of typing
- [x] Fix transition logic to properly hide intro and show homepage content
- [x] Ensure onComplete callback is working correctly
- [x] Test timing and smooth transitions
- [x] Add theme support with light grey/spectrum for light mode and space-like colors for dark mode
- [x] Pass isDarkMode prop from App.jsx to IntroAnimation

## Phase 2: Test and deploy corrected animation
- [x] Test locally to verify both fixes work (Animation working perfectly - word-by-word writing and smooth transitions confirmed)
- [x] Build and deploy updated version (Successfully deployed to https://gyvkwhdd.manus.space)
- [x] Verify deployed version works correctly (Animation working perfectly on production)

## Phase 3: Deliver fixed results to user
- [x] Document fixes and deliver final results (Successfully delivered with comprehensive documentation and live deployment)
