# Email Functionality Diagnosis

## Problem Identified

The contact form is currently trying to send emails to a non-existent backend API endpoint:
```
https://3005-i1cglnf8uh2n9trw2zj6f-22ecaed3.manusvm.computer/api/contact
```

This URL is from a previous development session and is no longer accessible, causing all email submissions to fail silently.

## Current Implementation Issues

1. **Dead Backend URL**: The form posts to a URL that no longer exists
2. **No Error Handling**: Users don't see any error messages when submission fails
3. **No Alternative Email Service**: No fallback email service like EmailJS or Formspree

## Solution Options

1. **EmailJS Integration** (Recommended)
   - Client-side email service
   - No backend required
   - Easy to set up with Gmail
   - Free tier available

2. **Formspree Integration**
   - Form handling service
   - Simple integration
   - Email notifications

3. **Custom Backend**
   - Create new Flask backend
   - More control but requires deployment

## Recommended Approach

Use EmailJS for immediate fix:
- Quick implementation
- Works with user's Gmail (munwai3939728@gmail.com)
- No backend deployment needed
- Reliable service
