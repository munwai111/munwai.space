# Line Graph Fix Results

## Issue Identified and Fixed

**Problem**: The Learning Journey Timeline line graph was extending beyond its axis boundaries, causing visual overflow and poor chart presentation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Proper Margin System**
- Added consistent margins: `marginLeft: 80px`, `marginRight: 80px`, `marginTop: 60px`, `marginBottom: 100px`
- Calculated plot area dimensions properly using margins
- Ensured all chart elements respect the defined boundaries

### 2. **Clipping Path Implementation**
- Added SVG `clipPath` definition to constrain chart content within plot area
- Applied clipping to line path and area fill to prevent overflow
- Kept data points outside clipping to ensure full visibility

### 3. **Improved Positioning Calculations**
- Updated `getPointPosition()` function to use proper plot area dimensions
- Added buffer to `maxValue` calculation for better visual spacing
- Positioned grid lines, axes, and labels within proper boundaries

### 4. **Enhanced Grid System**
- Grid lines now properly span only the plot area
- Y-axis labels positioned correctly outside the plot area
- X-axis labels positioned below the plot area with adequate spacing

## Visual Verification

✅ **Line Graph Now Properly Contained**: The certification progress line stays within the defined chart boundaries
✅ **Proper Axis Alignment**: All grid lines, axes, and labels are correctly positioned
✅ **Data Points Visible**: All data points remain fully visible and interactive
✅ **Professional Appearance**: Chart now has proper margins and spacing
✅ **Responsive Design**: Chart maintains proper boundaries across all screen sizes

## Technical Details

- **Chart Dimensions**: 700px width × 320px height
- **Plot Area**: 540px width × 160px height (after margins)
- **Clipping Applied**: Line path and area fill constrained to plot area
- **Data Points**: Positioned correctly with hover effects intact
- **Grid Lines**: Properly aligned with Y-axis values and plot boundaries

The line graph now displays professionally with all content properly contained within its axis boundaries.
