# Email Functionality Test Results

## Test Performed
- **Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Environment**: Local development server (localhost:5173)
- **Test Data**:
  - Name: Test User
  - Email: test@example.com
  - Message: "This is a test message to verify the fixed email functionality works correctly."

## Results
- **Form Submission**: ✅ Form accepts input and submits without errors
- **Validation**: ✅ Form validation working correctly
- **Email Service**: ❌ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

## Issue Found
The Formspree endpoint `https://formspree.io/f/xdkogqpb` used in the email service is a placeholder and needs to be configured with a real Formspree account.

## Current Status
- Form submission works without JavaScript errors
- No notification appears because the Formspree endpoint is not configured
- Need to either:
  1. Set up a real Formspree account and get a valid endpoint
  2. Use an alternative email service
  3. Implement a simple mailto fallback as the primary solution

## Recommended Solution
Since the user needs immediate email functionality, implement a direct mailto solution that opens the user's email client with pre-filled information. This is the most reliable approach that doesn't depend on external services.

## Next Steps
1. Update email service to use mailto as primary method
2. Add proper user feedback for the mailto action
3. Test the updated implementation
4. Deploy the working solution
